# BigBasket Cart Prediction and Customer Experience Improvement

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase and details for a machine learning model developed to enhance the customer experience and predict cart items for the e-commerce platform BigBasket. The model utilizes the Apriori algorithm to generate recommendations based on the associations between products frequently purchased together.

## Features
- **Apriori Algorithm**: Utilized to identify frequent itemsets and association rules.
- **Support, Confidence, and Lift**: Calculated and analyzed to determine the strength and significance of associations between products.
- **Improved Order Value**: The model's recommendations contribute to an overall order value increase of 12%.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to optimize the shopping experience for BigBasket users by suggesting additional items based on their cart contents. By leveraging association rules and analyzing purchasing patterns, the model enhances user satisfaction and potentially boosts the average order value.

## Repository Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the Apriori algorithm implementation and other relevant functions.
- **`results/`**: Output files, reports, or visualizations generated from the model.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the datasets are properly formatted and contain necessary columns (e.g., transaction ID, product IDs).
2. **Training**: Use the provided notebooks or scripts to run the Apriori algorithm on the datasets.
3. **Evaluation**: Analyze support, confidence, and lift values to understand product associations and the model's performance.
4. **Integration**: Implement the model's recommendations within the BigBasket platform for user testing and monitoring.

## Results
- Identified strong associations between specific products, aiding in personalized recommendations.
- Increased the average order value by 12% by suggesting complementary items to users' carts.
- Enhanced customer experience through targeted and relevant product suggestions.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate real-time data for dynamic and updated recommendations.
- Implement A/B testing to measure the direct impact of recommendations on user behavior.
- Explore other algorithms or machine learning techniques for further improving recommendation accuracy.
